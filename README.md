# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component

![Design preview for the NFT preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-desing.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


Hi, Im Angel Garcia. Im starting in web development. I was recommended the site 'Frondend Mentor' for practice and I took a look at this small but interesting practice. 

## To be considered
- I dont know anything about CSS Grid and Flex box
- I dont know anything about responsive design. I mean I dont know how to apply it or how it works. I only know the "theory". 
- I have less than 1 month learning css. I dont know much about best practices. 
- I wanted to apply the knowledge I have learned in a course I am currently taking. 

**I welcome any helpful comments about things to improve in my code. 		Thanks :tw-1f601:**
